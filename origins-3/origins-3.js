He used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time which basically means as orbiting objects like planets get closer to the sun they speed up and when farther away they go slower.

The hearth bricks are from a special type of rock only found deep in the planet's interior where players battle an earth elemental and fire elemental. The fire is started and maintained from the essence of a fire elemental. The bellows must be filled with the essence of an air elemental. The ore of the sickle comes from a meteorite. The sickle blade must be quenched in oil and water when complete though that water must come from the essence of a water elemental.","/str",{"VAR=":"EpicWeaponAbout"},"str","^SEASON TEMPLATE 1","/str",{"VAR=":"Seasont1"},"str","^EPISODE 1","/str",{"VAR=":"St1EpisodeOne"},"str","^EPISODE 2","/str",{"VAR=":"St1EpisodeTwo"},"str","^EPISODE 3","/str",{"VAR=":"St1EpisodeThree"},"str","^EPISODE 4","/str",{"VAR=":"St1EpisodeFour"},"str","^EPISODE 5","/str",{"VAR=":"St1EpisodeFive"},"/ev","end",null],"#f":1}],"listDefs":{"inventory":{"none":1,"flint_and_steel":2},"kits":{"zero":1,"ClimbingKit":2,"HerbalistKit":3},"weapons":{"fists":1,"dagger":2},"armor":{"none":1,"leather":2,"chain_mail":3,"plate_armor":4},"healing":{"none":1,"potion_of_minor_healing":2},"specialItems":{"none":1,"AirEssence":2,"EarthEssence":3,"FireEssence":4,"WaterEssence":5},"ore":{"none":1,"CopperOre":2,"IronOre":3,"MeteoriteOre":4,"ThoriumOre":5,"PalladiumOre":6}}};
