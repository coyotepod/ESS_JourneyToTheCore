During a round, each player takes a turn deciding what action(s) to take. The order of turns is determined when everyone rolls initiative (d20) at the very beginning of the combat encounter.

The GM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised. (2) Establish positions: The GM decides where all the characters and Monsters are located. Given the adventurers’ Marching Order or their stated positions in the room or other location, the GM figures out where the adversaries are̶how far away and in what direction. (3) Roll Initiative: Everyone involved in the combat encounter rolls Initiative, determining the order of combatants’ turns. (4) Take turns. Each participant in the battle takes a turn in Initiative order. (5) Begin the next round. When everyone involved in the combat has had a turn, the round ends.
