He used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time which basically means as orbiting objects like planets get closer to the sun they speed up and when farther away they go slower.

They even collected a piece of the fireball! Its been said they've predicted many great events in the ether over the past few decades. They can say when the moon will turn blood red or when nearby stars seem to brighten. The Queen is concerned they are using dark magic to make these events happen. The mages are notoriously reclusive and have offered little information to anyone - even the Queen herself. She can't openly accuse them of ill doing, but she's willing to make secret inquiries into their predictions. She will pay handsomely for valuable information.
